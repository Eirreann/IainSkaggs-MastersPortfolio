This package is a modification of the standard asset first-person characters so that they play nicely with controllers. They use the following virtual axes for controls:

    Horizonal & Vertical - movement
    Mouse X & Mouse Y - looking
    Jump
    Run

Define those in the input manager (Project Settings -> Input) in order set up the controls. Default setup in Unity:

    Horizonal & Vertical - arrow keys or WASD keys
    Mouse X & Mouse Y - mouse movement
    Jump - spacebar
    Run - not assigned

A Xbox 360 InputManager.asset setup is included in this package that has the following controls:

    Horizonal & Vertical - left stick or arrow keys or WASD keys
    Mouse X & Mouse Y - right stick or mouse movement
    Jump - A button or spacebar
    Run - press left stick or shift

To use that InputManager:

    1. Close Unity and open up your project folder in explorer/finder.
    2. Make a backup of ProjectSettings/InputManager.asset (in case you want to go back to your previous setup).
    3. Replace ProjectSettings/InputManager.asset with the InputManager.asset in this package.
    4. Boot up Unity!
